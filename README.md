In Terminal type this:
```bash
pacman --needed --noconfirm -Sy dialog git
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoltixOS/noltix-installer/refs/heads/main/updater
chmod +x updater
./updater


Normal installation: Run setup with `setup --debug`

Manual installation: Run setup with `setup --debug`, after you have started the Updater

Than look for error-messages and write it down. Please report the error in the [Issue](https://github.com/Niklas20114552/arch-tui-installer/issues)-Tab. But first check if it has already been reported
